#  Funding Monitor 
A Python script that monitors funding availability on a website and sends WhatsApp alerts using the Twilio API.

##  What does this script do?
This script was developed for a client who wanted to receive WhatsApp notifications whenever funding amounts changed on their website. The website fetches data directly via a secured API, making Selenium the best choice for extracting the necessary information.

##  Features
- Monitors funding availability in real-time.
- Logs all detected changes in `alerts.log`.
- Sends WhatsApp alerts when funding amounts change.
- Configurable via `settings.ini`.
- Successfully tested to work without crashes or blocking.

##  Twilio Account Required  
To send WhatsApp messages, you need a Twilio account. Twilio provides **$5 - $15** in free credits for new accounts, which is enough for testing. You can sign up at [Twilio's website](https://www.twilio.com/).
